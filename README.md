## Getting Started with STM32F407
*Contains all of my process in understanding microprocessor.*

I currently study in Mechatronics Engineering.
Which is the combination of Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Informatics Engineering. 
In Informatics side, understanding the microprocessor (5W+1H) is pretty necessary. 

>At the first time, I know nothing. And this is what I asked google to help me out.:thumbsup:

## Progress Blink Code 
*November 11th, 2017
*So, the first thing I try in programming microprocessor is blinking STM32F407

Before making the project, we have to download and install some apps which is :
1. Cross ARM GNU
2. Plugins release
3. STM32 Toolchain
4. Pack STM32 Electronics
5. Eclipse (For your programming platform)

When all of the 'apps' already installed, I found blink program. When I try to run the program, I found :
