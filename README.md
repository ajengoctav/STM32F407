## Getting Started with STM32F407
*Contains all of my process in understanding microprocessor.*

I currently study in Mechatronics Engineering.
Which is the combination of Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Informatics Engineering. 
In Informatics side, understanding the microprocessor (5W+1H) is pretty necessary. 

>At the first time, I know nothing. And this is what I asked google to help me out.:thumbsup:
